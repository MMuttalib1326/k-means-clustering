# k-means-clustering

What is k-means clustering used for? The K-means clustering algorithm is used to find groups which have not been explicitly labeled in the data. This can be used to confirm business assumptions about what types of groups exist or to identify unknown groups in complex data sets.

What is k-means clustering in machine learning?
K-means is a data clustering approach for unsupervised machine learning that can separate unlabeled data into a predetermined number of disjoint groups of equal variance – clusters – based on their similarities. It's a popular algorithm thanks to its ease of use and speed on large datasets.
